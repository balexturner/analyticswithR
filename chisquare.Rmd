#Pearson's Chi-Squared Test 

Pearson's Chi-Squared Test is used to evaluate 

* The **goodness of fit** between observed and estimated values.

* **Homogeneity** between groups regarding their distribution among categorical variables.

* Whether or not two variables whose frequencies are represented in a contingency table have **statistical independence** from one another.

##Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Independence

The Chi-Square Test for **Independence** is used to test whether or not two categorical variables are statistically independent of eachother. 

### Assumptions

* 2 Categorical Variables

* Random Sample

* Each category contains >= 5 observations.

###Example

The table below shows number of male and female titanic passengers. 

* **Row 1** shows non-survivors

* **Row 2** shows survivors

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)

titanic_survival<- data.frame(Titanic)%>%
  group_by(Sex, Survived)%>%
  summarize(freq=sum(Freq))%>%
  spread(Sex, freq)%>%
  subset(select=c("Male","Female"))

kable(titanic_survival)
```

We can use a chi-squared test for independence to determine  whether or not survival and sex are statistically independent from eachother.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
chisq.test(titanic_survival)
```

A p-value <.01 tells us that we can conclude that sex and survival are **not** independent from eachother with 99% confidence.
