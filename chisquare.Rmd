#Pearson's Chi-Squared Test 

Pearson's Chi-Squared Test is used to evaluate 

* The **goodness of fit** between observed and estimated values.

* **Homogeneity** between groups regarding their distribution among categorical variables.

* Whether or not two variables whose frequencies are represented in a contingency table have **statistical independence** from one another.

<br/>

##Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Independence

<hr width="90%">

The Chi-SquaredTest for **Independence** is used to test whether or not two categorical variables are statistically independent of eachother. 

<hr width="90%">

#### Assumptions

* 2 Categorical Variables

* Random Sample

* Each category contains >= 5 observations.

####Example

The table below shows number of male and female titanic passengers by Survival.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)

titanic_survival<- data.frame(Titanic)%>%
  group_by(Sex, Survived)%>%
  summarize(freq=sum(Freq))%>%
  spread(Sex, freq)%>%
  subset(select=c("Survived", "Male","Female"))

kable(titanic_survival)

```

We can use a chi-squared test for independence to determine  whether or not survival and sex are statistically independent from eachother.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
titanic_survival <- titanic_survival%>%
  subset(select=c("Male","Female"))  #Drop the "Survived" vector so that the table is read as a crosstab by chisq.test()

chisq.test(titanic_survival)
```

A p-value <.01 tells us that we can conclude that sex and survival are **not** independent from eachother with 99% confidence.

##Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Goodness of Fit

<hr width="90%">

The Chi-Squared Test for **Goodness of Fit** allows us to assess whether or not there are statistically significant differences between an observed and an expected distribution. The **p-value** indicates the level of statistical significance of the difference between the observed & expected distributions. 

* Lower p-value = Greater difference between distributions

* Higher p-value = Less difference between distributions

<hr width="90%">

####Let's say we are expecting observations to be equally distributed between 3 groups (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).

<hr width="90%">

**Good Fit:** Units evenly distributed between 3 groups.
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#Create lists of values for this exercise
observed_distribution <- c(10, 10, 10)           #Number of observations in each group
expected_distribution <- c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)       #Expected distribution across groups


#Run Chi Squared test
chisq.test(observed_distribution, p=expected_distribution)
```

A p-value = 1 indicates a no difference between the observed and the expected distribution. The expected distribution is a good fit for the observed data.

<br/>

**Bad Fit:** Units not evenly distributed between 3 groups.
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#Create lists of values for this exercise
observed_distribution <- c(3, 17, 10)           #Number of observations in each group
expected_distribution <- c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)       #Expected distribution across groups

#Run Chi Squared test
chisq.test(observed_distribution, p=expected_distribution)
```

A p-value = .007447 indicates a statistically significant difference at significance level of .01 between the observed and the expected distribution. The expected distribution is not a good fit for the observed data.

##Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Homogeneity

<hr width="90%">

The Chi-Squared Test for **Homogeneity** allows us to evaluate whether or not two samples are distributed equally across various levels/categories.The **p-value** indicates the level of statistical significance of the difference between the observed & expected distributions. 

* Lower p-value = More Heterogeneous

* Higher p-value = More Homogeneous

<hr width="90%">

####Let's say we want to test for homogeneity between two samples (A and B) in how they are distributed between 4 categories.

<hr width="90%">

**Heterogenous Example:** Two samples differ in their distribution between the 4 categories/levels.

*First, let's produce sample data with a heterogenous distribution across 4 categories/levels.*
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
A <- sample(1:4,  #Levels
                     200,  #Number of Observations
                     p=c(1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4), #Probabilities for Each Level
                     replace=TRUE) #"Replace" if sample larger than population.


B = sample(1:4,  #Levels
                     200,  #Number of Observations
                     p=c(1/8,1/16,3/16,2.5/4), #Probabilities for Each Level
                     replace=TRUE) #"Replace" if sample larger than population.

AB<- rbind(table(A),table(B))

kable(AB)
```

<br/>

*Now, let's run the Chi Squared Test for Homogeneity*
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
chisq.test(AB)
```
A p-value less than the signficiance level of .1/.05/.01 tells us that these groups show statistically significant differences in their distributions between the 4 categories. **The samples are heterogeneous**


<br/>
<br/>

**Homogenous Example:** Two samples show a similar distribution between 4 categories.

*First, let's produce sample data with a heterogenous distribution across 4 categories/levels.*
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
A <- sample(1:4,  #Levels
                     200,  #Number of Observations
                     p=c(1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4), #Probabilities for Each Level
                     replace=TRUE) #"Replace" if sample larger than population.


B = sample(1:4,  #Levels
                     200,  #Number of Observations
                     p=c(1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4), #Probabilities for Each Level
                     replace=TRUE) #"Replace" if sample larger than population.

AB<- rbind(table(A),table(B))

kable(AB)
```

*Now, let's run the Chi Squared Test for Homogeneity*
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
chisq.test(AB)
```
A p-value greater than the signficiance level of .1/.05/.01 tells us that these groups do not show statistically significant differences in their distributions between the 4 categories. **The samples are homogeneous**
