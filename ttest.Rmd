#t-tests

t-tests are used to determine whether the differences between the means of two normally distributed groups are statistically significant.

<br/>

##Independent t-test

Independent t-tests are used to assess the differences between the means of two separate, unrelated groups. Also known as **2-sample t-tests**, **independent sample t-tests**, and **student's t-tests**.

###Example

Consider the following 2 distributions. 

* **Group A** (left) has a normal distribution, with a mean of -1

* **Group B** (center) has a normal distribution, with a mean of +1

* When we plot them together (right), the difference is visible
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)


groupA <- c(rnorm(1500, mean = -1))  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of -1 & normal distribtion
groupB <- c(rnorm(1500, mean = 1))  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of 1 & normal distribtion

normal_hist_A <- data.frame(groupA)
normal_hist_B <- data.frame(groupB)
groupAB <- data.frame(groupA, groupB)%>%
  gather(groupAB)



A<- ggplot(normal_hist_A, aes(groupA, fill=groupA)) + geom_histogram() 
B<- ggplot(normal_hist_B, aes(groupB, fill=groupB)) + geom_histogram() 
AB<- ggplot(groupAB, aes(value, fill=groupAB)) + geom_histogram() +theme(legend.position="none")

grid.arrange(A,B,AB, ncol=3)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Example: This chunk not shown. t.test output only
listA <- rnorm(1500, mean = -1)  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of -1 & normal distribtion
listB <- rnorm(1500, mean = 1)  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of 1 & normal distribtion

t.test(listA,listB)
```

* Large **t-value** and a Small **p-value <.01** =  we accept the hypothesis that the means of list A and list B show statistically significant differences at a 99% confidence interval.

* **listA mean** is estimated at -.99 and **listB mean** is estimated at 1.03. 

* The mean differences are listed as well showing the lowest & highest possible differences at 95% confidence.

###Running Independent t-tests
<br/>

####If data are contained in 2 separate lists:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
listA <- rnorm(1500, mean = -1)  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of -1 & normal distribtion
listB <- rnorm(1500, mean = 1)  #Produce list of random values w/ mean of 1 & normal distribtion
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#This chunk not shown, only output.
groupAB <- data.frame(listA, listB)
kable(head(groupAB))
```


**t.test syntax:** t.test(variableA, variableB)
```{r}
t.test(listA,listB) #If data are contained in two separate lists
```

<br/>

####If data are contained in 1 dataset, distinguished by a binary grouping variable:

```{r}
groupAB <- data.frame(listA, listB)%>%
           gather(groupAB)

kable(head(groupAB))
```

**t.test syntax:** t.test(continuous_var~binary_var, data=data)

```{r}
t.test(value~groupAB, data=groupAB) 
```

<br/>

##Paired t-tests

If two sets of observations are made on the same subjets, in a before-and-after or other similar scenario, you can used a paired t-test

**t.test syntax:** t.test(continuous_var~binary_var, paried=TRUE, data=data)
```{r}
t.test(value~groupAB, paired=TRUE, data=groupAB) 
```
* Large **t-value** and a Small **p-value <.01** =  we accept the hypothesis that the means of listA and listB show statistically significant differences at a 99% confidence interval.

* The **mean of the differences:** As the name implies, this shows the mean of the differences between groups. *When comparing experimental results on the same group of subjects, this might be considered something of an effect size*.
